#CSP-and-Genetic-Algorithm

This project aims at optimizing the scheduling of exams for a university. There are N courses to be scheduled and K exam halls available.
Each course has a specific set of time slots available for scheduling its exam, and each exam hall can be used for a certain number of hours
per day.
In addition, some pairs of courses have conflicting students, meaning that they cannot be scheduled at the same time.
Use of genetic algorithm to find a feasible and optimal schedule.
